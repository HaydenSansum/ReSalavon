## MIT Media Lab - Recreating the Past - Class 7: Jason Salavon & Nancy Burson

The MIT Media Lab class - Recreating the Past - explores a number of influential artists who have, over the past century, added their own unique perspective on computational art. Each week focuses on a new artist and through exploring their view point and recreating their artworks I hope to gain a valuable window into their thought processes, helping me learn how to express my own opinions through computational art.
